## Welcome

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button above, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Setup

This section ensures some packages that you'll need are loaded.

```{r}
library(here)
library(socviz)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
here::i_am("course_notes.Rmd") # relative to the course packet.
```

## Notes

Regular text goes here.

R code goes in chunks that look like this:

```{r}
# rcode

1 + 1
```
