## Quarto

This is a quarto file. Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Setup

Here we load some packages that we'll be using.

```{r}
library(here)
library(socviz)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
here::i_am("course_notes.qmd") # relative to the course packet.
```


## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
