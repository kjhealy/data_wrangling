# The Course Packet

This packet contains the course material, data, slides, and code. It’s
an RStudio project, so to launch it, double-click on
`data_wrangling.Rproj` and RStudio will open with this project ready to
go.

## What’s here

### The `course_notes.Rmd` document

An RMarkdown document to get you started on taking your own notes for
the course.

### The `data/` folder

Datasets we will use during the course.

### The `code/` folder

All of the code snippets from the slides, in a form you can use.

### The `pdf_slides/` folder

PDF versions of the slides from the course.

### The `slides/` folder

RMarkdown files and various supporting files to generate HTML versions
of the slides. The HTML versions can be viewed in a web browser. These
RMarkdown files require supporting packages that I did not ask you to
install beforehand, so do not expect them to work out of the box.
