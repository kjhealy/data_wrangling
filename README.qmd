# The Course Packet

This packet contains the course material, data, slides, and code. It's an RStudio project, so to launch it, double-click on `data_wrangling.Rproj` and RStudio will open with this project ready to go. 

## What's here

### The `course_notes.qmd` document

A quarto document to get you started on taking your own notes for the course. 

### The `data/` folder

Datasets we will use during the course.

### The `code/` folder

All of the code snippets from the slides, as R script files.

### The `pdf_slides/` folder

PDF versions of the slides from the course. 

### The `slides/` folder

Quarto files and various supporting files to generate HTML versions of the slides. The HTML versions can be viewed in a web browser. These files require supporting packages that I did not ask you to install beforehand, so do not expect them to work out of the box.
