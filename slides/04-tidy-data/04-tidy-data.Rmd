# Get your data into long-form

Very, very often, the solution to some data-wrangling problem in Tidyverse-focused workflow is:

--

## First, get the data into long format.

--

Then do the recoding thing that you want.

--

Then transform it back to something wider if needed.

---

# This isn't an .kjh-lblue[_iron_] rule

As we'll see later, .kjh-orange[`dplyr`] _is_ able to do "rowwise" operations if you need them.

# Sneak peek

  select(year, elem4:coll4)

# Tidy data

## Each variable has its own column.

## Each observation has its own row.

## Each value has its own cell.

--

When data is tidy in this way, the vectorized character of R's way of doing things works best.

# The most common .kjh-orange[`tidyr`] operation

Pivoting:

.SMALL[
```{r 04-tidy-data-10 }
edu
```

The "Level of Schooling Attained" measure is spread across the columns, from `elem4` to `coll4`.


This is fine for a compact table, but for us it should be a single measure, say, "education". 
]
---

# From wide to long with .kjh-green[`pivot_longer()`]

.SMALL.squish2[We're going to put the columns `elem4:coll4` into a new column, creating a new categorical measure named `education`. The numbers currently under each column will become a  new .kjh-green[value] column corresponding to that level of education. ]

```{r 04-tidy-data-11 }
edu %>% 
  pivot_longer(elem4:coll4, names_to = "education")
```

---

# From wide to long with .kjh-green[`pivot_longer()`]

.SMALL.squish2[We can name the value column to whatever we like. Here it's a number of people.]

```{r 04-tidy-data-12 }
edu %>% 
  pivot_longer(elem4:coll4, names_to = "education", values_to = "n")
```

---

# Let's .kjh-yellow[recode()] it while we're here

```{r 04-tidy-data-13 }
edu %>% 
  pivot_longer(elem4:coll4, names_to = "education", values_to = "n") %>% 
  mutate(education = recode(education, 
                            elem4 = "Elementary 4", elem8 = "Elementary 8", 
                            hs3 = "High School 3", hs4 = "High School 4",
                            coll3 = "College 3", coll4 = "College 4"))
  
```

.smaller.squish4[The argument order of .kjh-green[**`recode()`**] is inconsistent with other tidyverse functions and it may be superceded in the future.]

---

# .kjh-green[pivot_longer()] implies .kjh-green[pivot_wider()]

```{r 04-tidy-data-14 }
gapminder
```

---

# .kjh-green[pivot_longer()] implies .kjh-green[pivot_wider()]

```{r 04-tidy-data-15 }
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = lifeExp) #<<
```

---

# What about widening .kjh-yellow[_multiple_] columns?

.SMALL.squish2[
This is a pretty common problem. 

Our first thought ("Just don't mention the other columns") isn't it:
]
```{r 04-tidy-data-16 }
gapminder %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = lifeExp) 
```

.SMALL.squish2[`pop` and `gdpPercap` are still long, and now our table is really sparse.]


---

# What about widening .kjh-yellow[_multiple_] columns?

.SMALL.squish2[We need to specify that we want values from more than one column.]

.SMALL[
```{r 04-tidy-data-17 }
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = c(lifeExp, gdpPercap)) #<<
```
]

.SMALL.squish2[This will give us a very wide table, but it's what we wanted.]

---

# What about widening .kjh-yellow[_multiple_] columns?

.small.squish3[Let's see that again. This time, let's say we want to calculate some within-stratum statistics as we do it.]

```{r 04-tidy-data-18, echo = FALSE}
gen_cats <- function(x, N = 1000) {
    sample(x, N, replace = TRUE)
}

set.seed(101)
N <- 1000

income <- rnorm(N, 100, 50)

vars <- list(stratum = c(1:8),
          sex = c("M", "F"),
          race =  c("B", "W"),
          educ = c("HS", "BA"))

df <- as_tibble(map_dfc(vars, gen_cats))
df <- add_column(df, income)
```

```{r 04-tidy-data-19 }
# Some made-up data
df
```

???

Let’s say we want to transform this to a wider format, specifically by widening the educ column, so we end up with columns for both the HS and BA categories, and as we do so we want to calculate both the mean of income and the total n within each category of educ

---

```{r 04-tidy-data-20, include = FALSE}
df %>%
    group_by(sex, race, stratum, educ) %>% 
    summarize(mean_inc = mean(income),
              n = n()) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = (educ),
                values_from = c(mean_inc, n)) %>% 
    ungroup()
```

`r chunk_reveal("04-tidy-data-20", widths = c(40,60), title = "# Pivot wider while summarizing")`

--

"Over-grouping" is one way to hang on to variables you want during the summary process. All the action happens at the innermost group.

In this case, everthing outside (or to the left of) `stratum` is untouched.

---

# .kjh-green[separate()] and .kjh-green[unite()] columns

```{r 04-tidy-data-21 }
## tribble() lets you make tibbles by hand
df <- tribble(
  ~name, ~occupation,
  "Nero.Wolfe", "Private Detective",
  "Archie.Goodwin", "Personal Assistant",
  "Fritz.Brenner", "Cook and Butler",
  "Theodore.Horstmann", "Orchid Expert"
)

df

```

---

```{r 04-tidy-data-22, include=FALSE}
df %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("first", "last")) %>% 
  unite("full_name", first:last, sep = " ") %>% 
  unite("both_together", full_name:occupation, 
        sep = ", ", remove = FALSE)

```

`r chunk_reveal("04-tidy-data-22", widths = c(40,60), title = "# Separate and unite")`

---

```{r 04-tidy-data-23, include=FALSE}
df %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("first", "last")) %>% 
  unite("full_name", first:last) %>% 
  separate(full_name, into = c("first", "last"))

```

`r chunk_reveal("04-tidy-data-23", widths = c(40,60), title = "# Separate and unite")`

The underscore, `_`, is the default uniting character.
---

```{r 04-tidy-data-24, include=FALSE}
gss_sm %>%
    select(race, degree) %>% 
    mutate(racedeg = interaction(race, degree)) %>%
    group_by(racedeg) %>% 
    tally() %>% 
    separate(racedeg, sep = "\\.", into = c("race", "degree"))
```

`r chunk_reveal("04-tidy-data-24", widths = c(50,50), title = "# Separate and unite")`

This one is a bit trickier, and our first glimpse of a _regular expression_. 

We have to tell .kjh-green[**`separate()`**] to split on the period, not the space.
