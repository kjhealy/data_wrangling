# My Setup and Yours

&nbsp;

--

## Talking, Slides, and Live-Coding in RStudio 

## Follow along with RStudio yourself if you can

## The course packet is also an RStudio project and the place for your notes

---

# Goals for this first session

&nbsp;

--

## Some big-picture motivation & perspective

## Getting familiar with RStudio and its relationship to R

## Getting oriented to R and how it thinks

???
Maybe you're familiar with R already, but I don't assume it. So please bear with me. I do find that, often, it's good to revisit some of the basic features of R and RStudio, as very often people learn them on an as-needed basis, which leads to some gaps. So hopefully even if you are a bit familiar with these tools you'll learn some new things.

- Using R and the Tidyverse can be understood within this broader context. 

- The same principles would apply to, e.g., using Python or similar tools.

- Touch\-based user interface

- Foregrounds a single application

- Dislikes multi-tasking\*

- Hides the file system

# \*Multitasking

- Windows and pointers.

--

- Multi-tasking, multiple windows.

--

- Exposes and leverages the file system.

- Many specialized tools in concert.

- Underneath, it's the 1970s, UNIX, and the command-line.

- Better than they've ever been!

--

- Free! Open! Powerful!

--

- Friendly community! Many resources!

--

- But grounded in a UI paradigm that is increasingly far away from the everyday use of computing devices 

--

- So why do we use these tools?

# Questions

.less-medium[
- What is "real" in your project?

- What is the final output?

- How is it produced?

- How are changes managed?
]

---

# Different Answers

.pull-left.SMALL[

## In the Office model

- Formatted documents are real.

- Intermediate outputs are cut and pasted into documents.

- Changes are tracked inside files.

- Final output is often in the same format you've been working in, e.g. a Word file, or perhaps a PDF.

]

--

.pull-right.SMALL[

## In the Engineering model

- Plain-text files are real.

- Intermediate outputs are produced via code, often inside documents.

- Changes are tracked outside files.

- Final outputs are assembled programatically and converted to a desired output format.
]

---

# Different strengths and weaknesses

.pull-left.SMALL[

- Everyone knows Word, Excel, or Google Docs.

- "Track changes" is powerful and easy.

- Hm, why can't I remember how I made this figure?.

- Where did this table of results come from?.

- .small[`Paper_Submitted_Final_edits_FINAL_kh-1.docx`]

]

--

.pull-right.SMALL[

- Plain text is universally portable.

- Push button, recreate analysis.

- Why can't I make R do this simple thing?

- This version control stuff is a pain.

- .small[`Object of type 'closure' is not subsettable`]
