# The right frame of mind

- This is like learning how to drive a car, or how to cook in a kitchen ... or learning to speak a language.

--

- After some orientation to what's where, you will learn best by _doing_.

--

- Software is a pain, but you won't crash the car or burn your house down. 

???

- Don't be afraid of the IDE or code. Expect to be frustrated, and don't be surprised when things go wrong. Things will go wrong _constantly_. The software is a very powerful, very obedient, and _very_ dumb robot.

- But every time things "don't work", and every time you diagnose and fix them, you will become a little more adept at noticing and fixing these errors. And you will start to accumulate practical knowledge of common failures.

- So be like Jacques and keep at it.

Er. That's not right.

--

Welcome to floating point math!

---

# Logic and floating point arithmetic

.small[In Base 10, you can't precisely express fractions like] $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{9}$. .small[They come out as repeating decimals: 0.3333... or 0.1111... You _can_ cleanly represent fractions that use a prime factor of the base, which in the case of Base 10 are 2 and 5.] 

--

.small[Computers represent numbers as binary (i.e. Base 2) floating-points. In Base 2, the only prime factor is 2. So] $\frac{1}{5}$ or $\frac{1}{10}$ .small[in binary would be repeating.] 

---

# Logic and floating point arithmetic

When you do binary math on repeating numbers and convert back to decimals you get tiny leftovers, and this can mess up _logical_ comparisons of equality. The `all.equal()` function exists for this purpose.

--

```{r 02-about-r-18}
print(.1 + .2)
print(.1 + .2, digits=18)

all.equal(.1 + .2, 0.3)
```

---

# 3. .kjh-yellow[You can create objects] 

--

In fact, this is mostly what we will be doing

--

Objects are created by .kjh-red[assigning] a thing to a name:

```{r 02-about-r-24}
## name... gets ... this stuff
my_numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25, 10)

## name ... gets ... the output of the function `c()`
your_numbers <- c(5, 31, 71, 1, 3, 21, 6, 52)
```

--

The `c()` function _combines_ or _concatenates_ things

???

The core thing we do in R is _create objects_ by _assigning a thing to a name_. That thing is usually the output of some _function_. There are a lot of built-in functions.

We can create an object with the `c()` function and the *assignment operator*, `<-`. The `c()` function concatenates things together.


---

# The assignment operator

- The assignment operator performs the action of creating objects

--

- Use a keyboard shortcut to write it:

- Press `option` _and_ `-` on a Mac

- Press `alt` _and_ `-` on Windows


---

# Assignment with .kjh-green[`=`]

- You can use "`=`" as well as "`<-`" for assignment

```{r 02-about-r-25}
my_numbers = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25)

my_numbers
```


--

On the other hand, "`=`" has a different meaning when used in functions.

--

I'm going to use "`<-`" for assigment throughout. Just be consistent either way.

your_numbers <- c(5, 31, 71, 1, 3, 21, 6, 52)
```

```{r 02-get-started-3}

```

- Functions can be identified by the parentheses after their names.

```{r 02-get-started-4}
my_numbers 
```


```{r this_will_error, eval = FALSE}

# What functions usually do

- They perform .kjh-red[**actions**]

# What functions usually do

## Get the mean of what? Of x.
## You need to tell the function what x is
mean(x = my_numbers)

mean(x = your_numbers)
```

--

If you don't _name_ the arguments, R assumes you are providing them in the order the function expects.

```{r 02-about-r-27}
mean(your_numbers)
```

---

# What functions usually do

What arguments? Which order? Read the function's help page

```{r 02-about-r-28, eval=FALSE}
help(mean)
```

```{r 02-about-r-29, eval = FALSE}
## quicker
?mean
```

--

- How to read an R help page ... 

---

# What functions usually do


- Arguments often tell the function what to do in specific circumstances

```{r 02-about-r-30}
missing_numbers <- c(1:10, NA, 20, 32, 50, 104, 32, 147, 99, NA, 45)

mean(missing_numbers)

mean(missing_numbers, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

Or select from one of several options

```{r 02-about-r-31}
## Look at ?mean to see what `trim` does
mean(missing_numbers, na.rm = TRUE, trim = 0.1)
```


---

# What functions usually do


There are all kinds of functions. They return different things.

```{r 02-about-r-32}
summary(my_numbers)
```

--

You can assign the output of a function to a name, which turns it into an object. (Otherwise it'll send its output to the console.)

```{r 02-about-r-33}
my_summary <- summary(my_numbers)

my_summary
```

---

# What functions usually do

Objects hang around in your work environment until they are overwritten by you, or are deleted.

```{r 02-about-r-34, eval = FALSE}
## rm() function removes objects
rm(my_summary)

my_summary

## Error: object 'my_summary' not found
```

---

# Functions can be .kjh-yellow[nested]

```{r 02-about-r-35}
c(1:20)
```

--

```{r 02-about-r-36}
mean(c(1:20))
```

--

```{r 02-about-r-37}
summary(mean(c(1:20)))
```

```{r 02-about-r-38}
names(summary(mean(c(1:20))))
```

--

```{r 02-about-r-39}
length(names(summary(mean(c(1:20)))))
```

--

Nested functions are evaluated from the inside out.

---

# Use the pipe operator: .kjh-yellow[%>%]

.SMALL[Instead of nesting functions in parentheses, we can use the _pipe operator_:]


```{r 02-about-r-40}
c(1:20) %>% mean() %>% summary() %>% names() %>%  length()
```

--

.SMALL[Read this operator as "_.kjh-green[**and then**]_"]

--

.SMALL[Better, vertical space is free in R:]


```{r 02-about-r-41}
c(1:20) %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  names() %>% 
  length()
```

---

# Piped operations make code more .kjh-green[readable]

Not great, Bob:

```r
  serve(stir(pour_in_pan(whisk(crack_eggs(get_from_fridge(eggs), into = "bowl"), len = 40), temp = "med-high")))
```

--

Notice how the first thing you read is the last operation performed.

--

Really not much better:

```r
serve(
  stir(
    pour_in_pan(
      whisk(
        crack_eggs(
          get_from_fridge(eggs), 
        into = "bowl"), 
      len = 40), 
    temp = "med-high")
  )
)
```

---

# Piped operations make code more .kjh-green[readable]

Much nicer:

```r
eggs %>% 
  get_from_fridge() %>% 
  crack_eggs(into = "bowl") %>% 
  whisk(len = 40) %>% 
  pour_in_pan(temp = "med-high") %>% 
  stir() %>% 
  serve()

```

--

We'll still use nested parentheses quite a bit, often in the context of a function working inside a pipeline. But it's good not to have too many levels of nesting.

---


# Now showing at an R near you: .kjh-yellow[|>]

The pipe operator **`%>%`** is not part of Base R. It was introduced in a package called `magrittr`. 

--

It's been so successful, a version of it has been incorporated into Base R.

--

It is denoted by **`|>`**. But! It does not _quite_ replace **`%>%`** in every case.\* 


The magrittr pipe will continue to work as shown in these slides.

.footnote.tiny[.kjh-darkgrey[\*With the new pipe, you can only pass an object to the _first_ argument in a function. This is fine for most tidyverse pipelines, where the first argument is usually (implicitly) the data. But it does mean that most Base R functions will continue not to be easily piped, as most of them do not follow the convention of passing the current data as the first argument]]

class(summary(my_numbers)) # functions can be nested, and are evaluated from the inside out

- A _data frame_ is a list of vectors of the same length, where the vectors can be of different types (e.g. numeric, character, logical, etc)

- A _tibble_ is an enhanced data frame 

Tibbles have an enhanced print method, never coerce strings to factors, and provide stricter subsetting methods. (HW)

Again the object inspector is helpful here

# 6. .kjh-yellow[Arithmetic on vectors]

In R, all numbers are vectors of different sorts. Even single numbers ("scalars") are conceptually vectors of length 1.

--

- Arithmetic on vectors\* follows a series of _recycling rules_ that favor ease of expression of vectorized, "elementwise" operations.

.footnote.tiny[*And arrays, too.]

- See if you can predict what the following operations do: 

---

# 6. .kjh-yellow[Arithmetic on vectors]

```{r 02-about-r-57}
my_numbers

result1 <- my_numbers + 1

```

--

```{r 02-about-r-58}
result1
```

--

```{r 02-about-r-59}
result2 <- my_numbers + my_numbers

```

--

```{r 02-about-r-60}
result2
```


--


```{r 02-about-r-61, warning=TRUE}
two_nums <- c(5, 10)

result3 <- my_numbers + two_nums

```


--

```{r 02-about-r-62}
result3
```


---

# 6. .kjh-yellow[Arithmetic on vectors]

```{r 02-about-r-63, warning=TRUE}
three_nums <- c(1, 5, 10)

result4 <- my_numbers + three_nums

```

--

```{r 02-about-r-64}
result4
```

Note that you get a _warning_ here. It'll still do it, though! Don't ignore warnings until you understand what they mean.
