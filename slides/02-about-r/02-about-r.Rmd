# The right frame of mind

- This is like learning how to drive a car, or how to cook in a kitchen ... or learning to speak a language.

--

- After some orientation to what's where, you will learn best by _doing_.

--

- Software is a pain, but you won't crash the car or burn your house down. 

???

- Don't be afraid of the IDE or code. Expect to be frustrated, and don't be surprised when things go wrong. Things will go wrong _constantly_. The software is a very powerful, very obedient, and _very_ dumb robot.

- But every time things "don't work", and every time you diagnose and fix them, you will become a little more adept at noticing and fixing these errors. And you will start to accumulate practical knowledge of common failures.

- So be like Jacques and keep at it.

Welcome to floating point math!

---

# Logic and floating point arithmetic

.pull-left.w70[

In Base 10, you can't precisely express fractions like $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{9}$. They come out as repeating decimals: 0.3333... or 0.1111... You _can_ cleanly represent fractions that use a prime factor of the base, which in the case of Base 10 are 2 and 5. 

]

--

.pull-left.w70[

Computers represent numbers as binary (i.e. Base 2) floating-points. In Base 2, the only prime factor is 2. So $\frac{1}{5}$ or $\frac{1}{10}$ in binary would be repeating.

]

# Logic and floating point arithmetic

# 3. .kjh-yellow[You can create objects] 

--

In fact, this is mostly what we will be doing.

--

Objects are created by .kjh-red[assigning] a thing to a name:


```{r 02-about-r-26 }
## name... gets ... this stuff
my_numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25, 10)

## name ... gets ... the output of the function `c()`
your_numbers <- c(5, 31, 71, 1, 3, 21, 6, 52)
```

--

The .kjh-green[**`c()`**] function _combines_ or _concatenates_ things

???

The core thing we do in R is _create objects_ by _assigning a thing to a name_. That thing is usually the output of some _function_. There are a lot of built-in functions.

We can create an object with the `c()` function and the *assignment operator*, `<-`. The `c()` function concatenates things together.


---

# The assignment operator

- The assignment operator performs the action of creating objects

--

- Use a keyboard shortcut to write it:

- Press `option` _and_ `-` on a Mac

- Press `alt` _and_ `-` on Windows


---

# Assignment with .kjh-green[**`=`**]

- You can use .kjh-pink[**`=`**] as well as .kjh-pink[**`<-`**] for assignment.

.medium[
```{r 02-about-r-27 }
my_numbers = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25)

my_numbers
```
]

--

- On the other hand, .kjh-pink[**`=`**] has a different meaning when used in functions.

--

- I'm going to use .kjh-pink[**`<-`**] for assignment throughout. 


- Be consistent either way.

# What functions usually do

.medium[
```{r 02-about-r-38 }

]
--

You can assign the output of a function to a name, which turns it into an object. (Otherwise it'll send its output to the console.)

Really not much better:

# Pipelines make code more .kjh-green[readable]

  whisk(len = 40) |> 
  pour_in_pan(temp = "med-high") |> 
  stir() |> 
  serve()

```
]
--

- We'll still use nested parentheses quite a bit, often in the context of a function working inside a pipeline. But it's good not to have too many levels of nesting.

---


# The other pipe: .kjh-green[`%>%`]

- The Base R pipe operator, .kjh-green[**`|>`**] is a relatively recent addition to R. 

- Piping operations were originally introduced in a package called called `magrittr`, where it took the form .kjh-green[**`%>%`**]

--

- It's been so successful, a version of it has been incorporated into Base R.

--

- The Base R pipe _mostly_ but does not _quite_ work the same way as .kjh-green[**`%>%`**] in every case.


- We'll use the Base R pipe in this course, but you'll see the Magrittr pipe a lot out in the world.

.footnote.tiny[.kjh-darkgrey[\*With the Base R pipe, you can only pass an object to the _first_ argument in a function. This is fine for most tidyverse pipelines, where the first argument is usually (implicitly) the data. But it does mean that most Base R functions will continue not to be easily piped, as most of them do not follow the convention of passing the current data as the first argument]]

class(summary(my_numbers)) # functions can be nested, and are evaluated from the inside out

class(my_smry) # equivalent to the previous line

???

- A _data frame_ is a list of vectors of the same length, where the vectors can be of different types (e.g. numeric, character, logical, etc)

- A _tibble_ is an enhanced data frame 

Tibbles have an enhanced print method, never coerce strings to factors, and provide stricter subsetting methods. (HW)

Again the object inspector is helpful here

- The Tidyverse's enhanced `tibble`

.SMALL[
```{r 02-about-r-65 }
## tibbles are build on data frames 
titanic_tb <- as_tibble(titanic)

- A data frame and a tibble are both fundamentally a list of vectors of the same length, where the vectors can be of different types (e.g. numeric, character, logical, etc)

# 6. .kjh-yellow[Arithmetic on vectors]

- In R, all numbers are vectors of different sorts. Even single numbers ("scalars") are conceptually vectors of length 1.

--

- Arithmetic on vectors\* follows a series of _recycling rules_ that favor ease of expression of vectorized, "elementwise" operations.

.footnote.tiny[*And arrays, too.]

- See if you can predict what the following operations do: 

---

# 6. .kjh-yellow[Arithmetic on vectors]

```{r 02-about-r-67 }
my_numbers

result1 <- my_numbers + 1

```

--

```{r 02-about-r-68 }
result1
```

--

```{r 02-about-r-69 }
result2 <- my_numbers + my_numbers

```

--

```{r 02-about-r-70 }
result2
```


--


```{r 02-about-r-71, warning=TRUE}
two_nums <- c(5, 10)

result3 <- my_numbers + two_nums

```


--

```{r 02-about-r-72 }
result3
```


---

# 6. .kjh-yellow[Arithmetic on vectors]

```{r 02-about-r-73, warning=TRUE}
three_nums <- c(1, 5, 10)

result4 <- my_numbers + three_nums

```

--

```{r 02-about-r-74 }
result4
```

Note that you get a _warning_ here. It'll still do it, though! Don't ignore warnings until you understand what they mean.
