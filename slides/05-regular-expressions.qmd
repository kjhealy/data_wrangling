## Searching for patterns

A regular expression is a way of searching for a piece of text, or _pattern_, inside some larger body of text, called a _string_.

::::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
The simplest sort of search is like the "Find" functionality in a Word Processor. The pattern is a literal letter, number, punctuation mark, word or series of words; the text is a document searched one line at a time. The next step up is "Find and Replace".
    
:::::

::::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
Every pattern-searching function in `stringr` has the same basic form:    

```r
str_view(<STRING>, <PATTERN>, [...]) # where [...] means "maybe some options"
```

:::::

::::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

Functions that _replace_ as well as _detect_ strings all have this form:

```r
str_replace(<STRING>, <PATTERN>, <REPLACEMENT>)
```
    
:::::

::::: {.fragment fragment-index=4}
(If you think about it, [`<STRING>`]{.fg-orange}, [`<PATTERN>`]{.fg-orange} and [`<REPLACEMENT>`]{.fg-orange} above are all kinds of pattern: they are meant to "stand for" all kinds of text, not be taken literally.)    
:::::




## Searching for patterns

- Here I'll follow the exposition in Wickham & Grolemund (2017).

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-5"

x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")

str_view(x, "an", html=FALSE)
```

## Searching for patterns


::: {.incremental}
- Regular expressions get their real power from _wildcards_, i.e. tokens that match more than just literal strings, but also more general and more complex patterns.
- The most general pattern-matching token is, "Match everything!" This is represented by the period, or [.]{.fg-pink}
- But ... if [.]{.fg-pink} matches any character, how do you specifically match the literal character [.]{.fg-green}?
:::


## Escaping

::: {.incremental}
- You have to "escape" the period to tell the regex you want to match it exactly, rather than interpret it as meaning "match anything".
- regexs use the backslash, [\\]{.fg-pink}, to signal "escape the next character".
- To match a [.]{.fg-green}, you need the regex [\\.]{.fg-pink}
:::


::: {.notes}
You need to use an “escape” to tell the regular expression you want to match it exactly, not use its special behaviour. Like strings, regexs use the backslash, [\\]{.fg-pink}, to escape special behaviour. So to match an [.]{.fg-pink}, you need the regex [\\.]{.fg-pink]. Unfortunately this creates a problem. We use strings to represent regular expressions, and \ is also used as an escape symbol in strings. So to create the regular expression \. we need the string "\\.".

:::


## Hang on, I see a further problem

- We use strings to represent regular expressions. [\\]{.fg-pink} is also used as an escape symbol in strings. So to create the regular expression [\\.]{.fg-pink} we need the string [\\\\\.]{.fg-pink}

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-6"
# To create the regular expression, we need \\
dot <- "\\."

# But the expression itself only contains one:
writeLines(dot)

# And this tells R to look for an explicit .
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")
```


## But … how do you match a [literal]{.fg-yellow} [\\]{.fg-green}?

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-7"

x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)
#> a\b

str_view(x, "\\\\") # you need four!

```

## But … how do you match a [literal]{.fg-yellow} [\\]{.fg-green}?

This is the price we pay for having to express searches for patterns using a language containing these same characters, which we may also want to search for.

  I _promise_ this will pay off

## Matching start and end

- Use [\^]{.fg-pink} to match the start of a string.

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-8"
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
```

## Matching start and end

- Use [\^]{.fg-pink} to match the start of a string.

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-8b"
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
```

- Use [$]{.fg-pink} to match the end of a string.

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-9"
str_view(x, "a$")
```

## Matching start and end

- To force a regular expression to only match a complete string, anchor it with both [\^]{.fg-pink} and [$]{.fg-pink}


```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-10"
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "apple")

```


```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-11"
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```

## Matching character classes

[\\d]{.fg-pink} matches any digit.

[\\s]{.fg-pink} matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).

[abc]{.fg-pink} matches a, b, or c.

[\^abc]{.fg-pink} matches anything except a, b, or c.

::: {.notes}
Remember, to create a regular expression containing \d or \s, you’ll need to escape the \ for the string, so you’ll type "\\d" or "\\s".

:::


## Matching the [_special_]{.fg-yellow} characters

Look for a literal character that normally has special meaning in a regex:


```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-12"

str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "a[.]c")

```


```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-13"
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), ".[*]c")
```

This works for most (but not all) regex metacharacters: [$ . | ? * + ( ) \[ {]{.fg-pink}. Unfortunately, a few characters have special meaning even inside a character class and must be handled with backslash escapes. These are [\] \\ ^]{.fg-pink} and [-]{.fg-pink}

## Alternation

Use parentheses to make the precedence of the 'or' operator [**|**]{.fg-pink} clear:

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-14"
str_view(c("groy", "grey", "griy", "gray"), "gr(e|a)y")
```

## Repeated patterns

- [?]{.fg-pink} is 0 or 1
- [+]{.fg-pink} is 1 or more
- [\*]{.fg-pink} is 0 or more

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-15"
x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
```

## Repeated patterns

- [?]{.fg-pink} is 0 or 1
- [+]{.fg-pink} is 1 or more
- [\*]{.fg-pink} is 0 or more

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-16"
str_view(x, "CC+")
```

## Repeated patterns


- [?]{.fg-pink} is 0 or 1
- [+]{.fg-pink} is 1 or more
- [\*]{.fg-pink} is 0 or more


```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-17"
x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+')
```

## Exact numbers of repetitions

- [{n}]{.fg-pink} is exactly n
- [{n,}]{.fg-pink} is n or more
- [{,m}]{.fg-pink} is at most m
- [{n,m}]{.fg-pink} is between n and m

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-18"
str_view(x, "C{2}")
```

## Exact numbers of repetitions

- [{n}]{.fg-pink} is exactly n
- [{n,}]{.fg-pink} is n or more
- [{,m}]{.fg-pink} is at most m
- [{n,m}]{.fg-pink} is between n and m

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-19"
str_view(x, "C{2,}")
```
## Exact numbers of repetitions

- [{n}]{.fg-pink} is exactly n
- [{n,}]{.fg-pink} is n or more
- [{,m}]{.fg-pink} is at most m
- [{n,m}]{.fg-pink} is between n and m

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-20"
str_view(x, "C{2,3}")
```

## Exact numbers of repetitions

- [{n}]{.fg-pink} is exactly n
- [{n,}]{.fg-pink} is n or more
- [{,m}]{.fg-pink} is at most m
- [{n,m}]{.fg-pink} is between n and m

By default regexps use _greedy_ matches. You can make them match the _shortest_ string possible by putting a [?]{.fg-pink} after them. **This is often very useful!**

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-21"
str_view(x, 'C{2,3}?')
```

## Exact numbers of repetitions

- [{n}]{.fg-pink} is exactly n
- [{n,}]{.fg-pink} is n or more
- [{,m}]{.fg-pink} is at most m
- [{n,m}]{.fg-pink} is between n and m

By default these are _greedy_ matches. You can make them “lazy”, matching the shortest string possible by putting a [?]{.fg-pink} after them. **This is often very useful!**

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-22"
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+?')
```

## And [finally]{.fg-yellow} ... backreferences


```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-23"
fruit # built into stringr
```

## Grouping and backreferences

- Find all fruits that have a repeated pair of letters:

```{r }
#| label: "05-regular-expressions-24"
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```

## Grouping and backreferences

- Backreferences and grouping will be very useful for string _replacements_.


## OK that was a [lot]{.fg-red}

## Learning [and testing]{.fg-yellow} regexps

- Practice with a tester like [https://regexr.com](https://regexr.com) or [https://regex101.com](https://regex101.com)
- Or an app like [Patterns](https://krillapps.com/patterns/)
- The regex engine or "flavor" used by `stringr` is Perl- or PCRE2-like.
