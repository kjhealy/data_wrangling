## Getting familiar with RStudio

## Getting oriented to R and how it thinks

Maybe you're familiar with R already, but I don't assume it. So please bear with me. I do find that, often, it's good to revisit some of the basic features of R and RStudio, as very often people learn them on an as-needed basis, which leads to some gaps. So hopefully even if you are a bit familiar with these tools you'll learn some new things.
