## Get your data into long format

Very, very often, the solution to some data-wrangling problem in Tidyverse-focused workflow is:

::: {.fragment}
### [Get the data in long format]{.fg-lblue}
:::


::: {.fragment}
Then do the recoding thing that you want.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Then transform it back to something wider if needed.
:::

## This isn't an [_iron_]{.fg-lblue} rule

As we'll see later, [`dplyr`]{.fg-orange} _is_ able to do "rowwise" operations if you need them.

## Untidy data: common for good reasons

## Untidy data: common for good reasons

Storing data in long form is often _inefficient_

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-7"
library(covdata)
covus |> 
  filter(state == "NY") |> 
  select(date:fips, measure:count)
```

## Untidy data: common for good reasons

Storing data in wide form is _easier to display_ in a printed table

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-8"
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |> 
  group_by(species, island, year) |> 
  summarize(bill = round(mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),2)) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Untidy data: common for good reasons

Storing data in wide form is _easier to display_ in a printed table


```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-9"
penguins |> 
  group_by(species, island, year) |> 
  summarize(bill = round(mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = bill) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

## The most common [`tidyr`]{.fg-orange} operation

Pivoting:

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-10"
edu
```

- The "Level of Schooling Attained" measure is spread across the columns, from `elem4` to `coll4`.
- This is fine for a compact table, but for us it should be a single measure, say, "education". 

## Wide to long with [`pivot_longer()`]{.fg-green}

- We're going to put the columns `elem4:coll4` into a new column, creating a new categorical measure named `education`. The numbers currently under each column will become a  new [value]{.fg-green} column corresponding to that level of education. 

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-11"
edu |> 
  pivot_longer(elem4:coll4, names_to = "education")
```

## Wide to long with [`pivot_longer()`]{.fg-green}

- We can name the value column to whatever we like. Here it's a number of people.

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-12"
edu |> 
  pivot_longer(elem4:coll4, names_to = "education", values_to = "n")
```

## Let's [recode()]{.fg-green} it while we're here

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-13"
edu |> 
  pivot_longer(elem4:coll4, names_to = "education", values_to = "n") |> 
  mutate(education = recode(education, 
                            elem4 = "Elementary 4", elem8 = "Elementary 8", 
                            hs3 = "High School 3", hs4 = "High School 4",
                            coll3 = "College 3", coll4 = "College 4"))
  
```

- The argument order of [**`recode()`**]{.fg-green} is inconsistent with other tidyverse functions and it may be superceded in the future.

## [pivot_longer()]{.fg-green} implies [pivot_wider()]{.fg-green}

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-14"
gapminder
```

## [pivot_longer()]{.fg-green} implies [pivot_wider()]{.fg-green}

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-15"
gapminder |> 
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = lifeExp) #<<
```

## What about [_multiple_]{.fg-yellow} columns?

- This is a pretty common problem. A first thought ("Just don't mention the other columns") isn't it:

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-16"
gapminder |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = lifeExp) 
```

- `pop` and `gdpPercap` are still long, and now our table is really sparse.

## What about [_multiple_]{.fg-yellow} columns? 

::: {.smallcode}

We need to specify that we want values from more than one column.

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-17"
gapminder |> 
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = c(lifeExp, gdpPercap)) #<<
```

:::

- This will give us a very wide table, but it's what we wanted.

```{r}
#| label: "04-tidy-data-18"
#| echo: FALSE
gen_cats <- function(x, N = 1000) {
    sample(x, N, replace = TRUE)
}

set.seed(101)
N <- 1000

income <- rnorm(N, 100, 50)

vars <- list(stratum = c(1:8),
          sex = c("M", "F"),
          race =  c("B", "W"),
          educ = c("HS", "BA"))

dfstrat <- as_tibble(map_dfc(vars, gen_cats))
dfstrat <- add_column(dfstrat, income)
write_csv(dfstrat, here::here("data", "dfstrat.csv"))
```

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-19"
# Some made-up data
dfstrat <- read_csv(here::here("data", "dfstrat.csv"))
dfstrat 
```


::: {.notes}
Let’s say we want to transform this to a wider format, specifically by widening the educ column, so we end up with columns for both the HS and BA categories, and as we do so we want to calculate both the mean of income and the total n within each group.

:::

---

```{r}
#| label: "04-tidy-data-20"
#| include: FALSE
dfstrat <- read_csv(here::here("data", "dfstrat.csv"))
dfstrat |>
    group_by(sex, race, stratum, educ) |> 
    summarize(mean_inc = mean(income),
              n = n()) |>
    pivot_wider(names_from = (educ),
                values_from = c(mean_inc, n)) |> 
    ungroup()
```

`r chunq_reveal("04-tidy-data-20",  lcolw="50", rcolw="50", smallcode = TRUE, title = "Pivot wider while summarizing")`

Here we end up with sex-by-race-by-stratum in the rows, and the income-by-education means, and income-by-education Ns, in their own columns. 


# Separate and Unite

## [separate()]{.fg-green} and [unite()]{.fg-green} columns

```{r }
#| label: "04-tidy-data-21"
## tribble() lets you make tibbles by hand
df <- tribble(
  ~name, ~occupation,
  "Nero.Wolfe", "Private Detective",
  "Archie.Goodwin", "Personal Assistant",
  "Fritz.Brenner", "Cook and Butler",
  "Theodore.Horstmann", "Orchid Expert"
)

df

```

## [separate()]{.fg-green} and [unite()]{.fg-green} columns

df <- tribble(
  ~name, ~occupation,
  "Nero.Wolfe", "Private Detective",

  "Theodore.Horstmann", "Orchid Expert"
)

df

```

---

```{r}
#| label: "04-tidy-data-22"
#| include: FALSE
df |> 
  separate(name, into = c("first", "last")) |> 
  unite("full_name", first:last, sep = " ") |> 
  unite("both_together", full_name:occupation, 
        sep = ", ", remove = FALSE)

```

`r chunq_reveal("04-tidy-data-22",  lcolw="40", rcolw="60", smallcode = TRUE, title = "Separate and unite")`

```{r}
#| label: "04-tidy-data-23"
#| include: FALSE
df |> 
  separate(name, into = c("first", "last")) |> 
  unite("full_name", first:last) |> 
  separate(full_name, into = c("first", "last"))

```

`r chunq_reveal("04-tidy-data-23",  lcolw="40", rcolw="60", smallcode = TRUE, title = "Separate and unite")`

The underscore, `_`, is the default uniting character.
---

```{r}
#| label: "04-tidy-data-24"
#| include: FALSE
gss_sm |>
    select(race, degree) |> 
    mutate(racedeg = interaction(race, degree)) |>
    group_by(racedeg) |> 
    tally() |> 
    separate(racedeg, sep = "\\.", into = c("race", "degree"))
```

`r chunq_reveal("04-tidy-data-24",  lcolw="50", rcolw="50", smallcode = TRUE, title = "Separate and unite")`

This one is a bit trickier, and our first glimpse of a _regular expression_. 

We have to tell [**`separate()`**]{.fg-green} to split on the period, not the space.
