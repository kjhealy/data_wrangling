# Summarizing a Table

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-3}
## Just take a look at the columns we will work on
gss_sm %>%

```

We're just taking a look at the relevant columns here.

---

# Group by .kjh-orange[_one_] column or variable

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-4}

gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion)
```

Grouping just changes the logical structure of the tibble. 

---

`r chunk_reveal("03-dplyr-onecol-summary", widths = c(25,75), title = "# Group and summarize by .kjh-orange[_one_] column")`


```{r 03-dplyr-onecol-summary, include = FALSE}
gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion) %>% 
  summarize(total = n())
```

--

The function .kjh-green[**`n()`**] counts up the rows within each group.

--

All the other columns are dropped in the summary operation

--

Your original .kjh-pink[`gss_sm`] table is untouched

---

`r chunk_reveal("03-dplyr-twocol-summary", widths = c(25,75), title = "# Group and summarize by .kjh-orange[_two_] columns")`


```{r 03-dplyr-twocol-summary, include = FALSE}
gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>% 
  summarize(total = n())
```

--

The function .kjh-green[**`n()`**] counts up the rows within the _innermost_ (i.e. the rightmost) group.

---

`r chunk_reveal("03-dplyr-freq", widths = c(30,70), title = "# Calculate frequencies")`


```{r 03-dplyr-freq, include = FALSE}
gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>% 
  summarize(total = n()) %>% 
  mutate(freq = total / sum(total),
           pct = round((freq*100), 1))
```

--

The function .kjh-green[**`n()`**] counts up the rows 

--

Which rows? The ones fed down the pipeline

--

The _innermost_ (i.e. the rightmost) group.

---

# Pipelines carry assumptions forward

.small[
```{r 03-dplyr-basics-5}
gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>% #<<
  summarize(total = n()) %>% 
  mutate(freq = total / sum(total),
           pct = round((freq*100), 1))
```
]

Groups are carried forward till summarized or explicitly ungrouped

--

Summary calculations are done on the innermost group, which then "disappears". (Notice how it's no longer a group in the output.)

---

# Pipelines carry assumptions forward

.small[
```{r 03-dplyr-basics-6}
gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>% 
  summarize(total = n()) %>% 
  mutate(freq = total / sum(total),
           pct = round((freq*100), 1)) #<<
```
]

.kjh-green[**`mutate()`**] is quite clever. See how we can immediately use **`freq`**, even though we are creating it in the same .kjh-green[**`mutate()`**] expression.

---

# Convenience functions

.small[

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-7}
gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>% #<<
  summarize(total = n()) %>% #<<
  mutate(freq = total / sum(total),
           pct = round((freq*100), 1)) 
```
]

We're going to be doing this .kjh-green[**`group_by()`**] ... .kjh-green[**`n()`**] step a lot. Some shorthand for it would be useful.

.SMALL.squish3[.kjh-green[**`count()`**] returns ungrouped results, so there are no groups carry forward to the .kjh-green[**`mutate()`**] step.]

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-22}

.SMALL.squish3[With .kjh-green[**`count()`**], the `pct` values here are the marginals for the whole table.]

# Two lessons

## Check your tables!

-     Pipelines feed their content forward, so you need to make sure your results are not incorrect.

--

- Often, complex tables and graphs can be disturbingly plausible even when wrong.

--

- So, figure out what the result should be and test it!

--

- Starting with simple or toy cases can help with this process.

---

# Two lessons

## Inspect your pipes!

- Understand pipelines by running them forward or peeling them back a step at a time.

- This is a _very_ effective way to understand your own and other people's code.

# Following a pipeline

# Conditionals in .kjh-yellow[`select()`] and .kjh-yellow[`filter()`]

Some new data, this time on national rates of cadaveric organ donation:

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-27}
# library(socviz)
organdata
```

---

# Conditionals in .kjh-yellow[`select()`] and .kjh-yellow[`filter()`]

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-28}
organdata %>% 
  filter(consent_law == "Informed" & donors > 15) 
```

---

# Conditionals in .kjh-yellow[`select()`] and .kjh-yellow[`filter()`]

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-29}
organdata %>% 
  select(country, year, where(is.integer)) #<<
```

Use .kjh-green[**`where()`**] to test columns.

---

# Conditionals in .kjh-yellow[`select()`] and .kjh-yellow[`filter()`]

When telling .kjh-green[**`where()`**] use .kjh-green[**`is.integer()`**] to test each column, we don't put parentheses at the end of its name. If we did, R would try to evaluate .kjh-green[**`is.integer()`**] right then, and fail:

```r
> organdata %>% 
+   select(country, year, where(is.integer()))
Error: 0 arguments passed to 'is.integer' which requires 1
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.
```

This is true in similar situations elsewhere as well.

---

# Conditionals in .kjh-yellow[`select()`] and .kjh-yellow[`filter()`]

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-30}
organdata %>% 
  select(country, year, where(is.character))
```

We have functions like e.g. **`is.character()`**, **`is.numeric()`**, **`is.logical()`**, **`is.factor()`**, etc. All return either .kjh-green[`TRUE`] or .kjh-red[`FALSE`]. 

---

# Conditionals in .kjh-yellow[`select()`] and .kjh-yellow[`filter()`]

Sometimes we don't pass a function, but do want to use the result of one:

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-31}
organdata %>% 
  select(country, year, starts_with("gdp")) #<<
```

We have **`starts_with()`**, **`ends_with()`**, **`contains()`**, **`matches()`**, and **`num_range()`**. Collectively these are ".kjh-pink[tidy selectors]".

---

# Conditionals in .kjh-yellow[`select()`] and .kjh-yellow[`filter()`]

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-32}
organdata %>% 
  filter(country == "Australia" | country == "Canada") 
```

This could get cumbersome fast.

---

# Use .kjh-yellow[`%in%`] for multiple selections

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-33}
my_countries <- c("Australia", "Canada", "United States", "Ireland")

organdata %>% 
  filter(country %in% my_countries) #<<
```

---

# Negating .kjh-pink[`%in%`] 

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-34}
my_countries <- c("Australia", "Canada", "United States", "Ireland")

organdata %>% 
  filter(!(country %in% my_countries)) #<<
```

Also a bit awkward. There's no built-in "Not in" operator. 


---

# Negating .kjh-pink[`%in%`] 

We can make one!

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-35}
`%nin%` <- Negate(`%in%`) # this operator is included in the socviz package
```

.small.squish3[(The backticks are special here because we need to name an operator.)]

--
.SMALL[
```{r 03-dplyr-basics-36}
organdata %>% 
  filter(country %nin% my_countries) #<<

]


---

# Do more than one thing 

Earlier we saw this:

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-37}
gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(race, sex, degree) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), 
            mean_kids = mean(childs, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# Do more than one thing 

.SMALL.squish3[Similarly for `organdata` we might want to do:]

.small[

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-38}
organdata %>%  
  group_by(consent_law, country) %>%
  summarize(donors_mean = mean(donors, na.rm = TRUE),
            donors_sd = sd(donors, na.rm = TRUE),
            gdp_mean = mean(gdp, na.rm = TRUE),
            health_mean = mean(health, na.rm = TRUE),
            roads_mean = mean(roads, na.rm = TRUE))
```

]

This works, but it's really tedious. Also error-prone.

---

# Do more than one thing with .kjh-green[`across()`]

.SMALL.squish3[Instead, use `across()` to apply a function to more than one column.]

.SMALL[
```{r 03-across-pipeline-1}

my_vars <- c("gdp", "donors", "roads")

## nested parens again, but it's worth it
organdata %>% 
  group_by(consent_law, country) %>%
  summarize(across(my_vars,           
                   list(avg = mean),  
                   na.rm = TRUE))     
```
]

---

`r chunk_reveal("03-across-pipeline-1", widths = c(40,60), title = "# Let's look at that again")`

- .small.squish3[`my_vars` are selected by .kjh-green[**`across()`**]

--

- .small.squish3[.kjh-green[**`list()`**] of the form `result = function` gives the new columns that will be calculated.]

--

- .small.squish3[`na.rm = TRUE` is passed through to the functions inside the `list()`]

.small.squish3[In tidyverse functions, arguments that begin with a "`.`" generally have it in order to avoid confusion with existing items, or are "pronouns" referring to e.g. "the name of the thing we're currently talking about as we evaluate this function". ]

# This all works with .kjh-green[`mutate()`], too


```{r 03-dplyr-basics-44}
organdata %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), toupper)) %>% 
  select(where(is.character))

# Arrange rows and columns

Sort rows with .kjh-green[**`arrange()`**]

.pull-left[

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-45}
organdata %>% 
  group_by(consent_law, country) %>%
  summarize(donors = mean(donors, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(donors) %>% ##< 
  print(n = 5)
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-46}
organdata %>% 
  group_by(consent_law, country) %>%
  summarize(donors = mean(donors, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(donors)) %>%  ##<
  print(n = 5)
```

]

Using .kjh-green[**`arrange()`**] to order rows in this way won't respect groupings.

# More generally ...

```{r 03-dplyr-basics-47}
organdata %>% 
  group_by(consent_law, country) %>%
  summarize(donors = mean(donors, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  slice_max(donors, n = 5) #<<
```

.small.squish3[You can see that .kjh-green[**`slice_max()`**] respects grouping.]

.small.squish3[There's **`slice_min()`**, **`.slice_head()`**, **`slice_tail()`**, **`slice_sample()`**, and the most general one, **`slice()`**.]
